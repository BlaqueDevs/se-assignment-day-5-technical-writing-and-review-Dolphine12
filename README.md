## 1. How can understanding your audience’s expertise level (tech experts vs. regular folks) shape the way you present technical information?
Tailoring technical information based on audience's expertise level ensures clarity, engagement and effectiveness.
When Communicating with Tech Experts, they expect;
 In-depth techincal details, Data-driven insigths and system archiecture and Discussions on API's, Integration, scalability and security. 
 How to Present Information: 
   Use precise technical Lannguage
   Provide technical documentation, code snippets or system diagram
   highlight perfomance and customizatioin options.
When communicating with non-technical users require clear and simple explanations of how the softwares benefits them, and less focus on technical specifications and more on usability and outcomes.
